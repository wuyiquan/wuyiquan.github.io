<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a final year Ph.D. student of Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. [Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) and Prof. [Fei Wu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/wufei). I obtained my B.S. degree at Zhejiang University. I also collaborate with Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/xliu14) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Prof. [Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/aj/) from University of Innsbruck closely.

My research interest includes LLM, NLP, LegalAI and Causal Inference. I have published more than 10 papers includes ACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, AAAI, et al.

I am the main contributor of open-source legal LLM [wisdomInterrogatory](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory), by which I was invited to participate in the [Yunqi Conference](https://yunqi.aliyun.com/).

Now I'm also a visiting student in the University of Innsbruck, Austria. I am expected to graduate in June 2024 and seeking job opportunities. Please feel free to [contact me](wuyiquan@zju.edu.cn) if you are interested!
