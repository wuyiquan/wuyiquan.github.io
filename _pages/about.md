<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hello! I am an Assistant Professor (ZJU-100 Young Professor, Doctoral Supervisor) at Zhejiang University. I received my Ph.D. from Zhejiang University under the supervision of Prof. [Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) and Prof. [Fei Wu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/wufei). I also earned my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University. 

I actively collaborate with Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/xliu14) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Prof. [Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/aj/) from the University of Innsbruck.

My research interests encompass LegalAI, Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, and Causal Inference. I have published over 20 papers in prestigious conferences and journals such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, SIGIR, AAAI, KDD, and WWW.

I am the lead contributor to the open-source legal LLM project [wisdomInterrogatory](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory), which earned me an invitation to participate in the [Yunqi Conference](https://yunqi.aliyun.com/).

‚ùóÔ∏èWe are currently seeking graduate students. If you are interested in applying or collaborating with me, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:wuyiquan@zju.edu.cn).

[**wisdomInterrogatory**](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory) \| [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory?style=social&label=Stars)](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory) (Êô∫Êµ∑-ÂΩïÈóÆ in Chinese) is an open-source Legal LLM that involves constructing training data, accelerating model training, integrating knowledge bases, and developing evaluation metrics. The model offers legal assistance services such as Q&A, case analysis, and legal document generation. It has garnered over 400 stars, more than 6,730 downloads, and over 110,000 uses. As the **project leader**, I was invited to participate in the [Yunqi Conference](https://yunqi.aliyun.com/).

The model can also be accessed [online](https://modelscope.cn/studios/wisdomOcean/wisdomInterrogatory/summary).
