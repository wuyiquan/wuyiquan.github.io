<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hello! I'm currently wrapping up my Ph.D. journey at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. [Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) and Prof. [Fei Wu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/wufei). I obtained my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University. I closely collaborate with Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/xliu14) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Prof. [Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/aj/) from the University of Innsbruck.

My research interests include LLM, NLP, LegalAI, and Causal Inference. I have published more than 10 papers in conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, SIGIR, and AAAI, among others.

I am the main contributor to the open-source legal LLM project [wisdomInterrogatory](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory), which led to an invitation to participate in the [Yunqi Conference](https://yunqi.aliyun.com/).

Currently, I am also a visiting student at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. I expect to graduate in June 2024 and am seeking job opportunities. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:wuyiquan@zju.edu.cn) if you are interested!

[**wisdomInterrogatory**](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory) \| [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory?style=social&label=Stars)](https://github.com/zhihaiLLM/wisdomInterrogatory) (Êô∫Êµ∑-ÂΩïÈóÆ in Chinese) is an open-source Legal LLM that involves constructing training data, accelerating model training, integrating knowledge bases, and developing evaluation metrics. The model offers legal assistance services such as Q&A, case analysis, and legal document generation. It has garnered over 400 stars, more than 6,730 downloads, and over 110,000 uses. As the **project leader**, I was invited to participate in the [Yunqi Conference](https://yunqi.aliyun.com/).

The model can also be accessed [online](https://modelscope.cn/studios/wisdomOcean/wisdomInterrogatory/summary).
